# Cryptocurrency Price Prediction Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project is a web application for predicting cryptocurrency prices using LSTM models. The dashboard is built using Plotly Dash and provides visualization of actual and predicted closing prices for Bitcoin (BTC-USD), Ethereum (ETH-USD), and Cardano (ADA-USD).

The project is inspired by a [tutorial on stock price prediction](https://data-flair.training/blogs/stock-price-prediction-machine-learning-project-in-python/) by Data Flair.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Dat-TG/Cryptocurrency-Price-Prediction.git
   cd Cryptocurrency-Price-Prediction
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Application

1. Ensure your model file (`saved_model.h5`) and CSV data files are in the appropriate directories.

2. Run the Dash application:

   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```

3. Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8050/` to view the dashboard.

## Deployment

To deploy the application to Render:

1. Ensure your project contains `requirements.txt`.

2. Push your code to a GitHub repository.

3. Create a new Web Service on Render and connect it to your GitHub repository.

4. Render will automatically detect the `requirements.txt` and use it to build and run your app.

## Usage

- The dashboard contains three tabs for Bitcoin (BTC-USD), Ethereum (ETH-USD), and Cardano (ADA-USD), and one tab for comparison high-low and volume of them.
- Each tab of each cryptocurrency displays:
  - A combined graph showing actual vs. predicted closing prices.
  - A scatter plot of actual closing prices.
  - A scatter plot of LSTM predicted closing prices.
